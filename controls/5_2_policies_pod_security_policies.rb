  title 'Minimize the admission of privileged containers'
  desc "Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `securityContext.privileged` flag set to `true`.\n\nRationale: Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and devices. A container running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices.\nThere should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit privileged containers.\nIf you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP."

If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container.\nThere should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace.\nIf you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP."

The option exists (and is defaulted to true) to permit setuid binaries to run.\nIf you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP."

Capabilities are parts of the rights generally granted on a Linux system to the root user. In many cases applications running in containers do not require any capabilities to operate, so from the perspective of the principal of least privilege use of capabilities should be minimized."
