Care should be taken to only log Metadata for requests to Secrets, ConfigMaps, and TokenReviews, in order to avoid the risk of logging sensitive data. 2) Modification of pod and deployment objects. 3) Use of pods/exec, pods/portforward, pods/proxy and services/proxy. For most requests, minimally logging at the Metadata level is recommended (the most basic level of logging).'
