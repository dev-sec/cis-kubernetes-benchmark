  title 'Ensure that the cluster-admin role is only used where required'
  desc "The RBAC role `cluster-admin` provides wide-ranging powers over the environment and should be used only where and when needed.\n\nRationale: Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as `cluster-admin` provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as `cluster-admin` allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a `ClusterRoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a `RoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding's namespace, including the namespace itself."

  title 'Create administrative boundaries between resources using namespaces'
  desc "Use namespaces to isolate your Kubernetes objects.\n\nRationale: Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called `default`. You can create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access to namespace resources between different users."

  desc "Use network policies to isolate your cluster network.\n\nRationale: Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. `NetworkPolicy` resources use labels to select pods and define whitelist rules which allow traffic to the selected pods in addition to what is allowed by the isolation policy for a given namespace."

Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container."

  desc "Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers\n\nRationale: A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context."

  desc "Use Pod Security Policies (PSP) and RBAC authorization to mitigate the risk arising from using privileged containers.\n\nRationale: A number of components used by Kubernetes clusters currently make use of privileged containers (e.g. Container Network Interface plugins). Privileged containers pose a risk to the underlying host infrastructure. You should use PSP and RBAC or other forms of authorization to mitigate the risk arising out of such privileged container usage. PSPs should be in place to restrict access to create privileged containers to specific roles only, and access to those roles should be restricted using RBAC role bindings."
